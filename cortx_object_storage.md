# CORTX Object Storage: World's Only 100% Open Source Mass-Capacity Optimized Object Storage System

### Project Scope & Core Design Goals

| Project Scope      | Core Design Goals                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mass capacity | Object storage uniquely optimized for mass capacity storage devices       .                                                                                                       |
| Processor agnostic | Works with any processor.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Flexibility        | Highly flexible, works with HDD, SSD, and NVM.                                                                                                                                   |
| Scalability        | Massively Scalable. Scales up to a billion billion billion billion billion exabytes (2^206) and 1.3 billion billion billion billion (2^120) objects with unlimited object sizes. |
| Responsiveness     | Rapidly Responsive. Quickly retrieves data regardless of the scale using a novel Key-Value System that ensures low search latency across massive data sets.                      |
| Resilience         | Highly Resilient. Ensures a high tolerance for hardware failure and faster rebuild and recovery times using Network Erasure Coding, while remaining fully RAID-compatible.       |
| Transparency       | Provides specialized telemetry data and unmatched insight into system performance.                                                                                               |

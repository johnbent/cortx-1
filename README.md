# CORTX: World's Only 100% Open Source Mass-Capacity Optimized Data Platform

The amount of data the world is creating and collecting is increasing massively. The amount of data the world is storing is not. The models and machine learning that are at the forefront of some of the most important research today depend on access to compete data sets, but limitations on storage lead to unnecessary data loss. By creating better, more economical storage solutions, we enable the research that is changing the world.

<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/at_risk_data.jpg?raw=true" title="This graph, using data from IDC, shows the amount of at-risk data increasing annually.  CORTX enables the mass capacity drives that will allow this at-risk data to be saved."/></p>

## The CORTX Project

CORTX is a set of open source software products.  These products are designed to reduce the costs of data services and to improve the efficiency of these data services when running on mass capacity storage devices.  By reducing costs and improving efficiencies, CORTX will allow the world to save more of its precious data.  **CORTX is 100% Open Source.** Most of the project is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](../main/LICENSE) and the rest is under AGPLv3; check the specific License file for each submodule to determine which is which.

Originally CORTX consisted of only the CORTX object storage system: an S3-compatible, highly scalable, self-healing storage system.  We are happy to announce that as of June 2021, the CORTX project has grown to include CORTX Pilot.  Pilot augments the CORTX object storage by adding data management, data orchestration, and fleet monitoring an management into CORTX.  For more details about each of these components, please refer to the following links:

## CORTX Community Values 

-   **Inclusive** - Our ambitions are global. The CORTX community is, too. The perspectives and skills necessary to achieve our goals are wide and varied; we believe in creating a community and a project that is inclusive, accessible, and welcoming to everyone.
-   **Open** - We are dedicated to remaining open and transparent. We believe in keeping CORTX Community code freely and fully available to be viewed, modified, and used without vendor lock-in or other in-built limitations.
-   **Inspired** - CORTX is all about the challenge. Our goals are not small: we want to build the world’s best scalable mass-capacity object storage system, one that can work with any hardware and interoperate with all workloads. CORTX is built on hard work, ingenuity, and an engineering mindset. We embrace hard problems and find inspired solutions.
-   **Evolving** – CORTX is continuously growing and adapting. As a community project, there is no limit to its development. We continuously make room for improvement and welcome the opportunities offered by the ever-evolving nature of community projects.

We are excited about your interest in CORTX and hope you will join us. We take our community very seriously, and we are committed to creating a community built on respectful interactions and inclusivity, as documented in our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  Because of our commitment to community, we work hard to track important community metrics; please feel free to check out how we do it and help us do it better in our [metrics folder](metrics).  We also publish our [Community Roadmap](Community_Roadmap.md); please let us know what other community events and milestones you would like to see.

Thank You!
